"""Script to do basic sanity checking for target_link_libraries() commands in
CMakeLists.txt files.

Scans C++ sources specified in add_library() commands for includes that look
like they are in the Quickstep source tree, then makes sure that the
corresponding libraries appear in the target_link_libraries() command for the
library.

TODO List / Known Issues & Limitations:
    - Script skips over targets that are built conditionally (i.e. that have
      multiple add_library() commands) and just prints a warning to the user.
    - Script only validates libraries, not executables.
    - Script only checks quickstep includes and libraries, so it will not
      detect missing third party libraries.
