 * @param column_vector A ColumnVector that will be downcast to its concrete

 * @param functor A generic functor or lambda that has a templated call
 *        operator taking a single argument. The call operator will be invoked
 *        with the downcast column_vector as its argument.
 * @return The return value of functor's call operator applied to the downcast
