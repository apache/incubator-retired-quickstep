 * @brief AggregationHandle encapsulates logic for actually computing
 *        aggregates with particular argument(s).
 * @note See also AggregateFunction, which represents a SQL aggregate function
 *       in the abstract sense.
 *
 * An AggregationHandle is created by calling
 * AggregateFunction::createHandle(). The AggregationHandle object provides
 * methods that are used to actually compute the aggregate, storing
 * intermediate results in AggregationState objects.
 *
 * I. The work-flow for computing an aggregate without GROUP BY is as follows:
 *     1. Create a global state for the aggregate with createInitialState().
 *     2. For each block in a relation (parallelizable):
 *        a. Call StorageBlock::aggregate() to accumulate results from the
 *           block (under the covers, this calls either
 *           accumulateColumnVectors() or accumulateValueAccessor() to do the
 *           actual per-block aggregation in a vectorized fashion).
 *        b. Merge the per-block results back with the global state by calling
 *           mergeStates() (this is threadsafe).
 *     3. Generate the final result by calling finalize() on the global state.
 *
 * II. The work-flow for computing an aggregate with GROUP BY is as follows:
 *     1. Create a HashTable to hold per-group states by calling
 *        createGroupByHashTable().
 *     2. For each block in a relation (parallelizable):
 *        a. Call StorageBlock::aggregateGroupBy() to update the states in the
 *           HashTable according to the values in the block (under the covers,
 *           this calls aggregateValueAccessorIntoHashTable() to aggregate over
 *           all the values/groups in a block in one shot; this is threadsafe).
 *     3. Generate the final set of groups and their corresponding results by
 *        calling finalizeHashTable().
 *
 * See also AggregationOperationState, which holds 1 or more global states or
 * HashTables for an aggregate query, and has some logic to re-use common
 * information across multiple aggregates being computed on the same block
 * (e.g. the set of matches for a predicate, or the values of computed GROUP BY
 * expressions). AggregationOperationState also has a method to write out
 * finalized aggregate values to an InsertDestination.
