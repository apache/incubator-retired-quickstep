 * @brief A class representing a particular aggregate function in the abstract
 *        sense. Each distinct, named aggregate function (e.g. AVG, COUNT, MAX,
 *        MIN, SUM) is represented by a singleton subclass of
 *        AggregateFunction.
 *
 * AggregateFunction provides informational methods about the applicability of
 * a particular aggregate function to particular argument Type(s). The actual
 * implementation of the aggregate functions' logic is in the AggregationHandle
 * class hierarchy, and can be different depending on the particular argument
 * Type(s) given to an aggregate. To perform an aggregation, a caller should
 * first call AggregateFunction::createHandle() to instantiate an
 * AggregationHandle object, then use the methods of AggregationHandle to do
 * the actual aggregation, then finally delete the AggregationHandle when
 * finished.
 * 
 * See AggregationHandle for more detailed information about how aggregates are
 * actually computed.
