/**
 * @brief Helper class for maintaining state during aggregation operation.
 *        If a GROUP BY list was provided, this class maintains a hash table
 *        for each aggregate computed where the key is the GROUP BY expression
 *        values and payload is each group's corresponding running aggregation
 *        state. Without GROUP BY, this class maintains a single aggregation
 *        state for each aggregate computed.
 * @note See also AggregationHandle, which encapsulates logic for actually
 *       computing aggregates, and AggregateFunction, which represents a
 *       particular SQL aggregate in the abstract sense.
 *
 * This class represents the common state for an instance of
 * AggregationOperator, and also encapsulates the high-level logic for
 * aggregating over blocks and generating final results.
 * AggregationWorkOrder::execute() is mainly just a call to aggregateBlock(),
 * while FinalizeAggregationWorkOrder::execute() is mainly just a call to
 * finalizeAggregate().

   * @brief Constructor for aggregation operation state.
   * @note The order of some of the parameters to this constructor (or the
   *       corresponding fields when reconstructing from a protobuf) determines
   *       the schema of tuples written out by finalizeAggregate(). If group_by
   *       is nonempty, the first attribute(s) will be the group-by values, in
   *       order. Following that will be the values for each aggregate
   *       specified by aggregate_functions (with arguments specified by
   *       attributes), in order.
   *
   * @param input_relation Input relation on which the aggregates are computed.
   * @param aggregate_functions A list of the aggregate functions to be
   *        computed.
   * @param arguments For each entry in aggregate_functions, a corresponding
   *        list of argument expressions to that aggregate. This is moved-from,
   *        with AggregationOperationState taking ownership.
   * @param is_distinct For each entry in aggregate_functions, whether DISTINCT
   *        should be applied to the entry's arguments.
   * @param group_by A list of expressions to compute the GROUP BY values. If
   *        empty, no grouping is used. This is moved-from, with
   *        AggregationOperationState taking ownership.
   * @param predicate The predicate to be applied prior to aggregation. nullptr
   *        indicates no predicate to be applied. This object takes ownership
   *        of predicate.
   * @param estimated_num_entries Estimated of number of entries in the hash
   *        table. A good estimate would be a fraction of total number of tuples
   *        in the input relation.
   * @param hash_table_impl_type The HashTable implementation to use for
   *        GROUP BY. Ignored if group_by is empty.
   * @param distinctify_hash_table_impl_type The HashTable implementation to use
   *        for the distinctify phase of each DISTINCT aggregation.
   * @param storage_manager The StorageManager to use for allocating hash
   *        tables. Single aggregation state (when GROUP BY list is not
   *        specified) is not allocated using memory from storage manager.
